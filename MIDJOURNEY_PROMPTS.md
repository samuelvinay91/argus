## 💡 Pro Tips for Midjourney

### 1. Upscaling
After generating, use these commands:
- `U1`, `U2`, `U3`, `U4` - Upscale specific image
- `Upscale (Subtle)` - Maintain details
- `Upscale (Creative)` - Add more details

### 2. Variations
- `V1`, `V2`, `V3`, `V4` - Create variations of specific image
- `Vary (Strong)` - More different variations
- `Vary (Subtle)` - Small tweaks

### 3. Remix Mode
Enable with `/settings` → Remix mode
- Change aspect ratios
- Modify prompts while keeping composition
- Add/remove elements

### 4. Style Reference
Use existing Argus branding:
```
[your prompt] --sref [URL to your brand image]
```

### 5. Negative Prompts
Add unwanted elements after `--no`:
```
--no text, watermark, signature, people, faces, cluttered, busy, chaotic
```

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### For OG Image:
1. Generate 4 variations using Prompt 1 (Tech Minimal)
2. Upscale best result
3. Download and resize to exactly 1200x630px
4. Test at https://www.opengraph.xyz/

### For Landing Page:
1. Start with Hero section (generate 3-4 options)
2. Create feature section icons (one style, consistent)
3. Generate process flow illustrations
4. Create CTA visual last (should complement hero)

### Consistency Tips:
- Use same `--style raw --v 6` for all images
- Reference teal color (#14b8a6) in every prompt
- Maintain "dark background, professional tech aesthetic" phrase
- Keep aspect ratios consistent within sections
